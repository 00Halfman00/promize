### Intro

Promize is just our really mediocre implementation of promises. It differs in some ways to make things easier for you all.

This is intended to be a no hand-holding exercise where you fight callbacks away by implementing a promise-like structure.

1. No special utilities, e.g. .race and/or .all
2. .catch propogates promises downwards still, dont worry about fully implementing catches actual behavior.

### Parts
1. Callbacks
2. Real Promise Practice (starts disabled)

2. **Clone your fork**
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run test:watch`
5. **Reenable test suites as you get up to them by deleting the `x` before `describe`**
